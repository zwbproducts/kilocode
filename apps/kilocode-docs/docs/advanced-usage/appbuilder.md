Kilo's **App Builder** lets you create end-to-end applications through natural language conversation. Describe what you want to build, watch it come to life in a real-time preview, and deploy directly from your Kilo dashboard. No local environment setup required.

---

## What App Builder Enables

- Build complete applications through conversation with AI
- Live preview that updates as your app takes shape
- One-click deployment to production
- Iterative refinement through natural language feedback
- Export code to continue development locally or in Cloud Agents

---

## Prerequisites

Before using App Builder:

- **Active Kilo Code account**  
  Sign up or log in at [app.kilo.ai](https://app.kilo.ai)

---

## Cost

- You pay only for the AI model usage via Kilo Code credits
- Credit consumption varies based on app complexity and number of iterations
- Deployment hosting is included during limited launch period

---

## How to Use

1. Navigate to **[App Builder](https://app.kilo.ai/app-builder)** from your Kilo dashboard.
2. Choose an **AI Model** for development (e.g., Grok Code Fast 1, Claude Sonnet 4.5, GPT-5.2).
3. Describe your application in plain language:
    - What it should do
    - Key features and functionality
    - Design preferences or constraints
4. Watch the **live preview** update as the AI generates your app.
5. Provide feedback to refine:
    - "Make the header sticky"
    - "Add a dark mode toggle"
    - "Connect this form to a database"
6. When satisfied, click **Deploy** to push your app live.

## How App Builder Works

- When you describe your application:

    1. The AI model interprets your requirements and generates an initial implementation.
    2. Code is rendered in real-time in the live preview panel.
    3. You can interact with the preview as if it were the deployed app.
    4. Each refinement request triggers targeted updates to the codebase.
    5. The AI maintains context across your entire conversation for coherent iteration.

- Deployment packages your application and provisions hosting automatically.

## Example Application Types

### Web Applications

- Landing pages and marketing sites
- Dashboards and admin panels
- SaaS products and internal tools
- Portfolio sites and blogs

### Interactive Tools

- Calculators and converters
- Form builders and survey tools
- Data visualization apps
- Productivity utilities

Anything that can be supported by a Next.js app can be built with App Builder!

---

## Perfect For

App Builder is ideal for:

- **Founders validating ideas quickly** without hiring developers
- **Developers prototyping** before committing to full implementation
- **Teams building internal tools** without diverting engineering resources
- **Designers bringing concepts to life** with functional code
- **Anyone with an app idea** but limited coding experience
- **Hackathons and rapid experimentation** where speed matters

---

## Limitations and Guidance

- Complex enterprise applications may require additional development outside App Builder.
- Some advanced integrations (e.g., specific third-party APIs) may need manual configuration.
- Live preview reflects most changes instantly, but some updates may require a brief rebuild.
