Kilo Integrations lets you connect your GitHub account (and soon, GitLab and Bitbucket) to enable advanced features inside Kilo Code. Once connected, Kilo can access your repositories securely through the **KiloConnect** GitHub App, enabling features like **Cloud Agents** and **Kilo Deploy**.

---

## What You Can Do With Integrations

- **Connect GitHub to Kilo Code** in a few clicks
- **Authorize the KiloConnect App** for repo access
- **Enable advanced features** like Cloud Agents and Kilo Deploy

---

## Prerequisites

Before connecting:

- You must have a **GitHub account**.
- You need permission to install GitHub Apps for the repositories you want Kilo to access.
- (Optional) If you're connecting an organization, you must be an **org admin** or have app installation permissions.

---

## Connecting GitHub to Kilo

### 1. Open the Integrations Page

Go to your **Personal** or **Organization Dashboard**, and navigate to the [Integrations](https://app.kilo.ai/integrations) tab

### 2. Start the Connection Flow

1. Click **Configure** on the GitHub panel.
2. You’ll be redirected to GitHub to authorize the **KiloConnect** App.
3. Select the GitHub account or organization you want to connect.

### 3. Choose Repository Access

GitHub will ask which repositories you want Kilo to access:

- **All repositories** (recommended if you plan to use Cloud Agents or Deploy across multiple projects)
- **Only selected repositories** (choose specific repos)

Click **Install & Authorize** to continue.

### 4. Complete Authorization

Once approved:

- You’ll return to the Kilo Integrations page.
- Github will show a **Connected** status.
- Your Kilo workspace can now access GitHub repositories securely.

## What Happens After Connecting

Once GitHub is connected, the following features will be enabled in Kilo:

### Cloud Agents

- Run Kilo Code in the cloud from any device
- Auto-create branches and push work continuously
- Work from anywhere while keeping your repo in sync

### Kilo Deploy

- Deploy Next.js 14 & 15 apps directly from Kilo
- Trigger rebuilds automatically on push
- Manage deployment logs and history

### Upcoming:

- **GitLab Integration**
- **Bitbucket Integration**

---

## Managing or Removing the Integration

From the same **Integrations** page, you can click "Manage on Github" to:

- View the GitHub account you connected
- Update which repositories Kilo has access to
- Disconnect GitHub entirely
- Reauthorize the app if permissions change

---

## Troubleshooting

**“I don’t see my repositories.”**  
Ensure the KiloConnect App is installed for the correct GitHub org and that repo access includes the repositories you need.

**“My organization blocks third-party apps.”**  
You may need an admin to approve installing GitHub Apps.

**“Cloud Agents or Deploy can’t access my repo.”**  
Revisit the GitHub app settings and confirm the app has the correct repo scope.
