# Kilo Slackbot

The Kilo Slackbot brings the power of Kilo Code directly into your Slack workspace. Ask questions about your repositories, request code implementations, or get help with issues—all without leaving Slack.

---

## What You Can Do With the Slackbot

- **Ask questions about your repositories** — Get explanations about code, architecture, or implementation details
- **Request code implementations** — Tell the bot to implement fixes or features suggested in Slack threads
- **Get help with debugging** — Share error messages or issues and get AI-powered assistance
- **Collaborate with your team** — Mention the bot in any channel to get help in context

---

## Prerequisites

Before using the Kilo Slackbot:

- You must have a **Kilo Code account** with available credits
- Your **GitHub Integration must be configured** via the [Integrations tab](https://app.kilo.ai/integrations) so the Slackbot can access your repositories 

To install the Kilo Slackbot, simply go to the integrations menu in the sidebar on https://app.kilo.ai and set up the Slack integration.

## How to Interact with the Slackbot

### Direct Messages

You can message the Kilo Slackbot directly through Slack DMs for private conversations:

1. Find **Kilo** in your Slack workspace's app list
2. Start a direct message conversation
3. Ask your question or describe what you need

This is ideal for:
- Private questions about your code
- Sensitive debugging sessions
- Personal productivity tasks

### Channel Mentions

Mention the bot in any channel where it's been added:

```
@Kilo can you explain how the authentication flow works in our backend?
```

This is great for:
- Team discussions where AI assistance would help
- Collaborative debugging sessions
- Getting quick answers during code reviews

---

## Use Cases

### Ask Questions About Your Repositories

Get instant answers about your codebase without switching contexts:

```
@Kilo what does the UserService class do in our main backend repo?
```

```
@Kilo how is error handling implemented in the payment processing module?
```

### Implement Fixes from Slack Discussions

When your team identifies an issue or improvement in a Slack thread, ask the bot to implement it:

```
@Kilo based on this thread, can you implement the fix for the null pointer exception in the order processing service?
```

The bot can:
- Read the context from the thread
- Understand the proposed solution
- Create a branch with the implementation
- Push the changes to your repository

### Debug Issues

Share error messages or stack traces and get help:

```
@Kilo I'm seeing this error in production:
[paste error message]
Can you help me understand what's causing it?
```

---

## How It Works

1. **Message the bot** — Either through DMs or by mentioning it in a channel
2. **Bot processes your request** — The Slackbot uses your connected GitHub repositories to understand context
3. **AI generates a response** — Kilo Code's AI analyzes your request and provides helpful responses
4. **Code changes (if requested)** — For implementation requests, the bot can create pull requests

---

## Cost

- **Kilo Code credits are used** when the Slackbot performs work (model usage, operations, etc.)
- Credit usage is similar to using Kilo Code through other interfaces

---

## Tips for Best Results

- **Be specific** — The more context you provide, the better the response
- **Reference specific files or functions** — Help the bot understand exactly what you're asking about
- **Use threads** — Keep related conversations in threads for better context
- **Specify the repository** — If you have multiple repos connected, mention which one you're asking about

---

## Limitations

- The Slackbot can only access repositories you've connected through the [Integrations](https://app.kilo.ai/integrations) page
- Complex multi-step implementations may require follow-up messages
- Response times may vary based on the complexity of your request

---

## Troubleshooting

**"The bot isn't responding."**  
Ensure the Kilo Slackbot is installed in your workspace and has been added to the channel you're using.

**"The bot can't access my repository."**  
Verify your GitHub integration is configured correctly in the [Integrations tab](https://app.kilo.ai/integrations).

**"I'm getting incomplete responses."**  
Try breaking your request into smaller, more specific questions.

**"The bot doesn't understand my codebase."**  
Make sure the repository you're asking about is connected and accessible through your GitHub integration.
