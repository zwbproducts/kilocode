# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standard for extending Kilo Code's capabilities by connecting to external tools and services. MCP servers provide additional tools and resources that help Kilo Code accomplish tasks beyond its built-in capabilities, such as accessing databases, custom APIs, and specialized functionality.

## MCP Documentation

This documentation is organized into several sections:

- [**Using MCP in Kilo Code**](/features/mcp/using-mcp-in-kilo-code) - Comprehensive guide to configuring, enabling, and managing MCP servers with Kilo Code. Includes server settings, tool approval, and troubleshooting.

- [**What is MCP?**](/features/mcp/what-is-mcp) - Clear explanation of the Model Context Protocol, its client-server architecture, and how it enables AI systems to interact with external tools.

- [**STDIO & SSE Transports**](/features/mcp/server-transports) - Detailed comparison of local (STDIO) and remote (SSE) transport mechanisms with deployment considerations for each approach.

- [**MCP vs API**](/features/mcp/mcp-vs-api) - Analysis of the fundamental distinction between MCP and REST APIs, explaining how they operate at different layers of abstraction for AI systems.
