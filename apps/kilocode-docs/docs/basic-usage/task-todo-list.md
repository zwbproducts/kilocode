# Task Todo List

**The big picture**: Never lose track of complex development tasks again. Task Todo Lists create interactive, persistent checklists that live right in your chat interface.

**Why it matters**: Complex workflows have lots of moving parts. Without structure, it's easy to miss steps, duplicate work, or forget what comes next.

## How to trigger todo lists

**Automatic triggers**:

- Complex tasks with multiple steps
- Working in Architect mode
- Multi-phase workflows with dependencies

**Manual triggers**:

- Ask Kilo to "use the [update_todo_list tool](/features/tools/update-todo-list)"
- Say "create a todo list"

**The bottom line**: Kilo decides what goes in the list, but you can provide feedback during approval dialogs.

## The old way vs. the new way

**Before**: You juggled task steps in your head or scattered notes, constantly wondering "what's next?"

**Now**: Kilo creates structured checklists that update automatically as work progresses. You see exactly where you are and what's coming up.

## Where todo lists appear

**1. Task Header Summary**
Quick progress overview with your next important item

**2. Interactive Tool Block**
Full todo interface in chat where you can:

- See all items and their status
- Edit descriptions when Kilo asks for approval
- Stage changes using the "Edit" button

**3. Environment Details**
Background "REMINDERS" table that keeps Kilo informed about current progress

## Task status decoded

**Pending** → Empty checkbox (not started)

**In Progress** → Yellow dot (currently working)

## Common questions

**"Can I create my own todo lists?"**
Yes, just ask Kilo to use the update_todo_list tool. But Kilo stays in control of the content and workflow.

**"What about simple tasks?"**
Kilo typically skips todo lists for simple tasks. The overhead isn't worth it.

**"Why can't I directly edit the list?"**
Design choice. Kilo maintains authority over task management to ensure consistent progress tracking. You provide input, Kilo executes.

## Pro tip: Auto-approval

**What it does**: Automatically approves todo list updates without confirmation prompts.

**When to use it**: Long workflows where constant interruptions slow you down.

**How to enable it**: Check the [Update Todo List auto-approval settings](/features/auto-approving-actions#update-todo-list).

**The catch**: Less control, but faster execution.
