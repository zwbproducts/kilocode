# API Providers Overview

**Bottom line**: Kilo Code, like any agentic AI coding tool, needs AI model providers to function. You can use our [built-in provider](/providers/kilocode) (easiest) or connect your own API keys from **30+ providers**.

## Kilo Code Extension vs. API Provider

### The Extension

- VS Code tool you install from the marketplace
- Handles UI, file operations, and workflow management
- [Open source](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode)
- Connects to any AI provider

### Kilo Gateway Provider

- **Built-in option** that comes with the extension
- Google sign-in with free credits included
- No API key management required
- Access to frontier coding models
- [Competitive pricing](https://kilo.ai/pricing)

**Key point**: The extension works with any provider—our API service is just the "batteries included" option.

## Getting Started: Two Paths

### Option 1: Built-in Provider (Recommended)

✅ **Fastest setup**

- Sign in with Google or GitHub at kilo.ai

### Option 2: Your Own Provider

## Why Use Multiple Providers?

- **Cost**: Compare pricing across providers
- **Models**: Access different AI capabilities
- **Reliability**: Backup options for outages
- **Features**: Some providers offer exclusive models
- **Regional**: Better performance in certain locations
