# Migrating from Other Tools

Switch to **Kilo Teams** or **Kilo Enterprise** from other AI coding tools and experience transparent pricing, no vendor lock-in, and superior team management capabilities.

## Why Teams Switch to Kilo

### Transparency vs. Opacity

**Other AI coding vendors** hide their true costs behind opaque subscription models, leaving you wondering what you're actually paying for.

**Kilo Teams** and **Kilo Enterprise** show you exactly what each AI request costs - no markup, no hidden fees, complete transparency.

### No Rate Limiting

**Other tools** slow you down with rate limits and model switching when you need AI most.

**Kilo Teams** and **Kilo Enterprise** never limit your usage - pay for what you use, use what you need.

### True Team Management

**Other solutions** offer basic user management with limited visibility.

**Kilo Teams** provides comprehensive team analytics, role-based permissions, and detailed usage insights, while **Kilo Enterprise** adds advanced governance, audit logging, and enterprise-level security controls.

## Technical Migration: Rules and Configurations

Kilo Code uses a compatible rules system that supports Cursor and Windsurf patterns. Migrating your custom rules and configurations is straightforward and typically takes 5-10 minutes per project.

**Quick Overview:**

- **Project rules**: `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` → `.kilocode/rules/*.md` (remove YAML frontmatter, keep Markdown content)
- **Legacy rules**: `.cursorrules` → `.kilocode/rules/legacy-rules.md`
- **AGENTS.md**: Works identically in Kilo Code (no conversion needed)
- **Global rules**: Recreate in `~/.kilocode/rules/*.md` directory

Kilo Code also supports mode-specific rules (`.kilocode/rules-{mode}/`), which Cursor and Windsurf don't have. This allows different rules for different workflows (e.g., Code mode vs Debug mode).

**👉 For detailed step-by-step instructions, format conversion examples, troubleshooting, and advanced migration scenarios, see our [Technical Migration Guide](/advanced-usage/migrating-from-cursor-windsurf).**

## Cost Comparison Analysis

### Hidden Costs in Other Tools

**Subscription Models Hide True Costs**

- Rate limiting forces inefficient workflows
- Model switching without notification

**Kilo Transparent Pricing**

- Pay exactly what AI providers charge
- See cost of every request in real-time
- No rate limiting or usage restrictions
- Choose optimal models for each task

### ROI Calculation Framework

**Current Tool Analysis**

1. **Monthly subscription costs** × team size
2. **Hidden productivity losses** from rate limiting
3. **Opportunity costs** from limited model access
4. **Management overhead** from poor team visibility

**Kilo Benefits**

1. **Transparent AI costs** (typically 30-50% lower)
2. **Productivity gains** from no rate limiting
3. **Better outcomes** from optimal model selection
4. **Reduced management time** with comprehensive analytics
