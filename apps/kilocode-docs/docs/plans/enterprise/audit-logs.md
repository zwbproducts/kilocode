# Audit Logs (Enterprise Only)

Audit Logs record key actions that occur in the management of your Kilo seats, including user logins, adding or removing models, providers, and modes, and role changes.

Owners and Admins can search and filter logs to review access patterns and ensure compliance.

## Viewing Audit Logs

Only **Owners** can view and filter through logs.

Go to **Enterprise Dashboard → Audit Logs** to view a searchable history of all organization events.
Use filters to narrow down results by action, user, or date range.
