# Single Sign-On (SSO) (Enterprise Only)

Kilo Enterprise lets your organization securely manage access using **Single Sign-On (SSO)**. With SSO enabled, team members can sign in to Kilo using your company’s existing identity provider, such as Okta, Github, Google Workspace, etc.

## Why Enable SSO?

- **Centralized access control:** Manage permissions through your existing identity provider.
- **Faster onboarding:** New team members automatically gain access when added to your company directory.
- **Improved security:** Enforce company-wide password, MFA, and session policies.
- **Easy offboarding:** Smoothly remove access when users leave your organization.

## Prerequisites

You’ll need:

- Admin or Owner permissions for your Kilo organization.
- Access to your **Identity Provider (IdP)** (e.g. Okta, Google Workspace, Azure AD).

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Open [Organization](https://app.kilo.ai/organizations) Dashboard

Find the Single Sign-On (SSO) Configuration panel, and click "Set up SSO":
