# AI Adoption Dashboard

The AI Adoption Dashboard helps engineering leaders understand how deeply and consistently their teams are using AI across development workflows. It provides a single **AI Adoption Score** (0–100) that quantifies organizational AI maturity, plus detailed breakdowns by dimension.

## Who Is It For?

This dashboard is designed for **team leads, engineering managers, and executives** who want to:

- Track AI integration progress across their organization
- Compare teams using a single benchmark number
- Identify low-, medium-, and high-adoption teams
- Quote a simple metric to stakeholders ("We're at 63; we want to be at 80")

## Accessing the Dashboard

1. Navigate to [app.kilo.ai](https://app.kilo.ai) and sign in
2. Select your organization
3. Click the **Usage** tab in the dashboard navigation
4. The AI Adoption Score card appears at the top of the usage view

## Dashboard Overview

### Main Score Display

The dashboard prominently displays your current AI Adoption Score as a percentage (e.g., "Current: 45%"). This score represents how deeply and consistently your organization uses AI across real development workflows.

### Timeline Visualization

<img src="/docs/img/ai-adoption/stacked-chart.png" alt="Monthly view of the AI Adoption Dashboard" width="300"  />

A stacked bar chart shows your daily adoption scores over time. The chart uses three colors representing the score's dimensions:

- **Blue** — Frequency (how often developers use AI)
- **Green** — Depth (how integrated AI is into development)
- **Orange** — Coverage (how broadly AI is adopted across the team)

### Time Period Filters

Filter the data by selecting:

- **Past Week** — Last 7 days
- **Past Month** — Last 30 days
- **Past Year** — Last 365 days
- **All** — Complete history

### Personal vs. Organization View

Use the **"Only my usage"** toggle to switch between:

- **Enabled** — Your individual adoption metrics
- **Disabled** — Organization-wide adoption metrics

### Trend Indicators

Four metric cards at the bottom of the dashboard show week-over-week changes:

- **Total** — Overall score trend
- **Frequency** — Changes in usage frequency
- **Depth** — Changes in integration depth
- **Coverage** — Changes in team-wide adoption

Each card displays the percentage change (e.g., "+2.3%" or "-1.5%") with a directional indicator.

## The Three Dimensions

The AI Adoption Score is composed of three weighted dimensions:

| Dimension     | Weight | Question It Answers                              |
| ------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Frequency** | 40%    | How often do developers use AI?                  |
| **Depth**     | 40%    | How integrated is AI into actual development?    |
| **Coverage**  | 20%    | How broadly is AI being adopted across the team? |

Click on any dimension card to view detailed analysis and improvement suggestions specific to that dimension.

## Quick Reference: Score Tiers

| Score Range | Tier                     | Description                              |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| 0–20        | Minimal adoption         | AI usage is sporadic or experimental     |
| 21–50       | Early adoption           | Some developers are using AI regularly   |
| 51–75       | Growing adoption         | AI is becoming part of team workflows    |
| 76–90       | Strong adoption          | AI is deeply integrated into development |
| 91–100      | AI-first engineering org | AI is central to how the team ships code |
