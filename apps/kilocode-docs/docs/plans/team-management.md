# Managing Your Team

Every person on the team is an _Owner_ or a _Member_.

Owners have full administrative oversight including billing, seat allocation, and model/provider selection.

Only Owners can conduct team management activities.

Members can use the Kilo Code extension and see data on the team's usage in the [usage dashboard](/plans/analytics).

2. **Click "Invite Member"** button
3. **Enter the team member's email address**
4. **Select initial role** (Member or Owner)
5. Click **Send Invitation**
