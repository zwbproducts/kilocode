# Template

# Overview

This section provides a concise description of the problem being addressed and the proposed solution.

What is important for the solution to accomplish? What can be left out of scope for now? Scope projects as tightly as possible, because smaller projects let us ship faster, get feedback faster, and avoid snowballing scope creep.

# Requirements

This section outlines the requirements that the solution will fulfill. Be comprehensive and detailed.

Find the minimum requirements that will deliver the minimal solution described in the Overview. Avoid the urge to solve all the problems at once.

### Non-requirements

-

# System Design

This is the core of the technical specification, detailing the architectural decisions and implementation plan. If possible, include diagrams!

## Scope/Implementation

This section should be a bulleted list of tasks that will eventually become github issues.

-

# Compliance Considerations

This section addresses any relevant compliance aspects, specifically regarding SOC 2.

# Features for the future

Talks about what we might want to build or improve upon in the future, but is out-of-scope of this spec.
