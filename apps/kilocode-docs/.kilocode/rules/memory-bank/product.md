# Product Overview

## What Kilo Code Is

Kilo Code is an open source AI agent VS Code extension that transforms how developers write code by providing intelligent, context-aware assistance directly within the VS Code editor. It serves as a persistent development partner that can understand projects, generate code, automate tasks, and provide suggestions.

## Problems It Solves

### Core Development Pain Points

- **Blank Page Syndrome**: Eliminates the struggle of starting new code or features from scratch
- **Context Switching**: Reduces time spent switching between documentation, Stack Overflow, and code
- **Repetitive Tasks**: Automates common development workflows like commit message generation, boilerplate creation, and file operations
- **Code Quality**: Helps with refactoring, debugging, and maintaining consistent coding standards
- **Project Understanding**: Assists in understanding large codebases and complex architectures

### AI Memory Limitations

- **Session Reset Problem**: Traditional AI assistants lose all context between sessions, requiring re-explanation of project details
- **Inefficient Context Gathering**: Without memory, AI must re-analyze entire codebases repeatedly, which is slow and expensive
- **Inconsistent Understanding**: Lack of persistent context leads to inconsistent suggestions and solutions

## How Kilo Code Works

### Core Interaction Model

Users interact with Kilo Code through a chat interface within VS Code, using natural language to describe what they want to accomplish. Kilo Code then uses specialized modes and tools to fulfill requests.

### Mode System

- **Code Mode**: General-purpose coding tasks, file editing, project creation
- **Architect Mode**: Planning, design, technical leadership, and documentation
- **Ask Mode**: Information gathering, explanations, and learning
- **Debug Mode**: Systematic problem diagnosis and troubleshooting
- **Custom Modes**: Unlimited specialized personas for specific workflows

### Tool Ecosystem

Kilo Code uses a sophisticated tool system organized into groups:

- **Read Tools**: File exploration, code analysis, project understanding
- **Edit Tools**: Code modification, file creation, precise surgical edits
- **Browser Tools**: Web automation and testing
- **Command Tools**: System command execution and build processes
- **MCP Tools**: External service integration through Model Context Protocol
- **Workflow Tools**: Task management, mode switching, progress tracking

### Memory Bank System

A revolutionary approach to AI context preservation that maintains project understanding across sessions through structured documentation files that both the AI and developers can access.
