# Current Context

## Project Status

The Kilo Code documentation site is a mature, production-ready Docusaurus project that serves as the comprehensive documentation hub for the Kilo Code VS Code extension. The site is hosted at https://kilo.ai/docs and provides extensive documentation covering installation, usage, features, and extension capabilities.

## Current Work Focus

**Memory Bank Initialization**: Currently performing comprehensive memory bank initialization to establish persistent project context for future AI interactions. This involves analyzing the entire documentation structure, understanding the project's purpose, and creating structured documentation files.

## Recent Changes

- Memory bank system being implemented with structured documentation files
- Product overview documented with comprehensive feature descriptions
- Project structure analyzed including all documentation categories and provider integrations

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized into several major sections:

### Core User Journey

- **Getting Started**: Installation, setup, and first task completion
- **Using Kilo Code**: Chat interface, modes, context mentions, and basic features
- **Core Concepts**: Auto-approving actions, suggested responses, tool usage, and checkpoints

### Advanced Features

- **Advanced Usage**: Prompt engineering, customization options, memory bank, and large project handling
- **Customization**: Settings management, custom modes, API configuration profiles
- **Extending Kilo Code**: Model providers (18+ supported), local models, MCP integration, shell integration

### Reference Materials

- **Tools Reference**: Comprehensive documentation of all 15+ available tools
- **Provider Documentation**: Detailed setup guides for Anthropic, OpenAI, and 16+ other AI providers
- **Community Resources**: Contributing guidelines, development environment setup

## Key Features Documented

### Core Capabilities

- Multi-mode AI assistance (Code, Architect, Ask, Debug, Custom)
- Comprehensive tool ecosystem for file operations, browser automation, and system commands
- Memory Bank system for persistent project context
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration for external tool connectivity

### User Experience Features

- Auto-generated commit messages with customizable templates
- Context mentions for precise file and code referencing
- Checkpoints for conversation state management
- Fast edits and surgical code modifications
- Browser automation for web testing and interaction

### Extensibility

- 18+ AI model providers supported
- Custom mode creation with file restrictions and tool limitations
- Local model support for privacy-conscious development
- MCP server integration for unlimited external tool connectivity

## Technical Implementation

The site uses modern web technologies:

- **Framework**: Docusaurus 3.8.1 for static site generation
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with VS Code-inspired design elements
- **Search**: Local search implementation with @easyops-cn/docusaurus-search-local
- **Analytics**: PostHog integration for usage tracking
- **Components**: Custom React components for enhanced documentation experience

## Next Steps

1. Complete memory bank initialization with remaining core files
2. Document the technical architecture and build system
3. Create task documentation for common documentation workflows
4. Validate all memory bank files for accuracy and completeness

## Important Considerations

- Documentation must remain accessible to both technical and non-technical users
- All provider documentation needs to stay current with API changes
- Memory bank system documentation serves as both user guide and implementation reference
- Community contributions are encouraged through GitHub discussions and pull requests
