- Deployment URL (Preview/Production)

From the deployment details, you can:

- Inspect previous builds
- Redeploy
- Delete deployments

## Database Support

Kilo Deploy does **not** include built-in database hosting, but you can connect to any external database service.

---

## Environment Variables

Kilo Deploy supports Environment Variables and Secrets. Add the variable **key** and **value** during the **Create New Deployment** step, and toggle to mark as secrets.

## Common Use Cases

Deploy is ideal for:

1. **Quick prototypes** — instantly push an idea live
2. **Staging environments** — share a preview environment
3. **Rapid iteration** — push commits and get automatic rebuilds
