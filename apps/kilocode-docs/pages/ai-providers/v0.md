# Using v0 With Kilo Code

Kilo Code supports v0, Vercel's AI model provider that offers an OpenAI-compatible API. This allows you to use v0's models with Kilo Code through the familiar OpenAI API interface.

## Prerequisites

To use v0 with Kilo Code, you'll need:

- A team account with Vercel v0
- A v0 API key

## Configuration

Setting up v0 in Kilo Code is straightforward:

1. In Kilo Code settings (click the {% codicon name="gear" /%} icon):
    - Under **API Provider**, select: **OpenAI Compatible**
    - Set the **Base URL**: `https://api.v0.dev/v1`
    - Paste in your v0 API key
    - Set the **Model ID**: `v0-1.0-md`
    - Click **Verify** to confirm the connection
